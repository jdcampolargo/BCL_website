# BCL Website

This project preserves and republishes the legacy of the [Biological Computer Laboratory (BCL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_Computer_Laboratory), the wonderful research lab at the University of Illinois.

The original site, created and maintained by Jamie Hutchinson, was once available at:  
ðŸ‘‰ [bcl.ece.illinois.edu (archived)](https://web.archive.org/web/20190316170955/http://bcl.ece.illinois.edu/)

The new version of the site lives here:  
ðŸ‘‰ [bclillinois.vercel.app](https://bclillinois.vercel.app/)

---

Jamie was kind enough to send me the full archive of files. I couldnâ€™t help myselfâ€”I had to bring it back. So here it is, live again for all to explore and enjoy.

Long live BCL âœ¨
